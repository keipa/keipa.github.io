# Why I Started Writing

I've been meaning to do this for years. Every few months I'd open a note, type a sentence or two about something I learned, and then close it and move on. The notes are still there — a graveyard of half-formed thoughts.

The problem with keeping things in notes is that writing *for yourself* is different from writing *to be read*. When I force myself to explain something clearly enough that a stranger could follow along, I usually discover I didn't understand it as well as I thought.

## What this is

This will mostly be technical. C#, .NET, cloud infrastructure, the kind of problems that come up when you're building systems that need to keep running whether or not you're watching. I work in enterprise environments — British Heart Foundation, Informa, a maritime logistics platform — and those contexts shape what I find interesting.

But I'll probably stray. I build electronics on weekends. I've been tinkering with machine learning for a few years. I have opinions about sleep that I take entirely too seriously.

## What this isn't

A tutorial blog. There are enough of those. I'm more interested in the *why* behind decisions — why a pattern feels right in one context and wrong in another, why we reached for one tool instead of another, what we got wrong in the first place.

If something I write is useful to you, I'm glad. If it changes how you think about a problem even slightly, that's enough.
